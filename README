PLEASE READ!!!!
THIS REPO IS MY ATTEMPT TO PERFORM MY LAB ASSIGNMENTS IN OS CLASS. I HAVE TO USE GITHUB BECAUSE IT WAS A GROUP ASSIGNMENT, WHICH IS NOT AS THE ORIGINAL EXCERCISE INTENDED (TO BE PERFORMED BY ONE PERSON). I DID NOT KNOW A BOUT GIT'S "FORK" HENCE I CLONED
THE ORIGINAL REPO AND CREATED A NEW ONE SO MY TEAMATE AND I CAN COLLABORATE. THEREFORE, THIS IS NOT MY WORK (APART FROM THOSE EDITED BRANCHES AND FILES WHICH ARE MY SOLUTIONS), PLEASE REFER TO THE ORIGINAL REPO VIA:
```
$ git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/xv6-labs-2023
```

AGAIN, THE XV6 SYSTEM HERE IS NOT MY WORK, I ONLY ADDED SOLUTIONS TO MY OWN ASSIGNMENTS. THIS REPO IS MERELY USED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE, NO COMMMERCIAL PURPOSE IS INTENDED OR CARRIED OUT. IF YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OR ANY PRIVILEDGED ADMINISTRATOR AND WISH THIS REPO
TO BE TAKEN DOWN, PLEASE CONTACT ME AND I WILL DELETE IT IMMEDIATLY.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDESTANDING.

MINH.
